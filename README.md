# Text-Generation
This project revolves around generating text based on learned patterns from previous textual data, a fundamental task in NLP with various applications in daily interactions.Below outlines the project's architecture:

Data Collection: Web scrape datasets from public URL using the requests library.

Data Cleaning: Conduct preprocessing steps including tokenization, punctuation removal, stop word elimination, and text conversion to lowercase.

Data Sequencing: Create sequences for training the model, selecting sets of words to predict the subsequent word.

Tokenization and Input-Output Creation: Tokenize the sequence data using the Keras library, embedding them as integers to construct input vectors (X) and labels (Y).

Model Construction: Build the neural network model, sequentially adding layers such as Input, Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers with 'relu' activation for modeling non-linearity and complex trends. Include a final Dense layer with 'softmax' activation to compute the probability distribution of word classes.

Evaluation and Example Generation: Define a function to process input text data through tokenization and padding, then generate output data using the predict_classes method of the model
